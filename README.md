# TucikMap

A prototype vector-tile map engine built with Swift and Metal. This project renders interactive maps using vector tiles (currently sourced from Mapbox) in a custom Metal-based renderer. It's still in early development, but it supports basic globe views, zooming, and labeling.

## Features
- Vector tile rendering with Metal for high-performance graphics.
- Interactive map controls (zoom, pan, pitch).
- Support for Mapbox tile sources (requires your own access token).
- SwiftUI integration for easy embedding in iOS/macOS apps.
- Debug options like grid overlay (disabled by default).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/artemcolt/TucikMap.git`
2. Open in Xcode.
3. Replace the Mapbox token in `ContentView.swift` with your own (get one at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)).
4. Build and run on iOS simulator or device.

## Usage
The core view is `TucikMapView`, configurable via `MapSettings`. See `ContentView.swift` for an example.
